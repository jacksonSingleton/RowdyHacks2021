### Implementation
Using `npm install` and then `npm start`, we're locally hosting a javascript reactjs/PIXIjs web application.
We use webkit API to detect the user's speech and determines the words used.
The WebApp then verifies the spoken words with the corressponding spell list and enacts a spell effect if there is a match.

## User Flow
The User opens the site and is introduced to a tutorial and tests out specific spells prompted in the middle of the screen.  
The User is then brought into a sandbox area to play around with the provided spells

#### Spell List
| Spell        |  Effect          | 
| ------------- |-------------:|  
| Avada Kadevera      | Killing Curse      |
| Lumos | Light Spell      |
| Nox      | Darkens Lumos | 
| Expecto Patronum      | Protection Spell      |
| Incindio      | Fire Summoning Spell | 
| Wingardium Leviosa      | Floating Spell |
